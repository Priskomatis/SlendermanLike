Skull decimated.obj is a low-resolution version. The full resolution one is too large for uploading on any 3D model sharing platform.
However, you can get the full-res version here:

If you have any trouble downloading it, contact me at:
chameleonscales@protonmail.com
Also, I'd love to see what you do with it if you'd like to show me!

WARNING: This is an unfinished project which needs more sculpting work, retopology and texturing (and possibly customizability if I'm up for it).
I plan to get back to it when I upgrade my computer (hopefully somewhere in 2019)

If you make improvements to the model and would like to share them under a CC BY license, please let me know.
